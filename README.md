Cli http client

My journy to learn rust required a project to code on so I decided to try to create a cli command for making http requests.

I am a big fan of [httpie](https://httpie.org/), and this is my vain attempt to try to implement somehting similar in rust.

My objective with this project is to learn rust and you probably don't want to use this for anything other than snickering from afar.

Changed line for Commit A.
